-> Installing TensorFlow on Ubuntu 
These instructions on machines meeting the following requirements:

    1. 64-bit desktops or laptops
    2. Ubuntu 14.04 or higher
################################################    
-> Determine which TensorFlow to install

You must choose one of the following types of TensorFlow to install:

1. TensorFlow with CPU support only.
    If your system does not have a NVIDIA® GPU, you must install this version. 
    Note that this version of TensorFlow is typically much easier to install (typically, in 5 or 10 minutes),
    so even if you have an NVIDIA GPU, we recommend installing this version first.
2. TensorFlow with GPU support.
  TensorFlow programs typically run significantly faster on a GPU than on a CPU.
  Therefore, if your system has a NVIDIA® GPU meeting the prerequisites shown 
  below and you need to run performance-critical applications, you should ultimately install this version.
###########################################################
-> Install TensorFlow by invoking one of the following commands:

$ pip install tensorflow      # Python 2.7; CPU support (no GPU support)
$ pip3 install tensorflow     # Python 3.n; CPU support (no GPU support)
$ pip install tensorflow-gpu  # Python 2.7;  GPU support
$ pip3 install tensorflow-gpu # Python 3.n; GPU support
